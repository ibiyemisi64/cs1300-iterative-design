      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>
        Our solution relied on user research that we conducted among 50+ college
        undergraduates (most of them from Brown). The goal of the research was
        to understand how Partiful could position itself to attract more target
        users from the student community and compete with other apps (such as
        Google Calendar, Eventbrite).
      </p>

      <h2>Research Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>How, if at all, the Partiful app is used on campus</li>
        <li>
          What features students need more support with when it comes to event
          planning
        </li>
        <li>What students use to plan and attend potluck-style events</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our research indicated that many respondents simply don’t know about
        Partiful. Respondents often rely on other apps or word-of-mouth. Based
        on this finding, further discussion helped us formulate two questions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>How to get Partiful in front of students?</li>
        <li>
          How to translate a word-of-mouth interaction into something that could
          happen in an app?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We aimed to solve these questions with our final design, Hi-Fi
        Prototype.

      <h3>User Flows</h3>
      <p>
        The final prototype demonstrates two primary user flows: one tailored
        for planners to create and manage event lists, and another designed for
        guests to select and claim items to bring. Select which flow to interact
        with using the "Flows" control panel on the left.

          <h4>Planner</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Create Custom Lists: Planners can easily create customizable lists
              for any event, allowing guests to sign up for specific items.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enhanced Templates: The prototype extends Partiful's template
              feature, supporting item sign-ups tailored to various event types.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manage Guest Contributions: Planners have the ability to edit the
              item list and commitments. This includes limiting the amount of
              users that can sign up for each item, and highlighting must-have
              items.
            </li>

        </div>

          <h4>Guest</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Claim Items: Guests can claim responsibility for bringing specific
              items to an event.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add Custom Items: Guests can add new, custom items to the list,
              ideal for potluck events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manage Personal Contributions: Guests have the ability to sign up,
              edit their item commitments, and view overall contributions
              clearly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented a flexible, horizontal feature enabling planners to
              create adaptable lists for any event type.

      <h3 class="py-3">Iterative Design Decisions</h3>
      <p>
        Feedback from mentors and company founders shaped the final hi-fi
        prototype. Positive responses highlighted strong features, while
        constructive suggestions helped refine usability, clarity, and flow.
      </p>
      <h4>Positive feedback</h4>

      <p>
        ❤️ "Contributions" is a good entry point for list creation.<br />
        ❤️ Social layer of claimed items in activity feed is good.<br />
        ❤️ Badges to gameify guest controbutions are great, and can extend
        current profile badge feature in Partiful.<br />
        ❤️ Refer a friend feature is nice, something that the comapny would like
        to continue doing.<br />
        ❤️ Sign-up feature looks more flexible.<br />
        ❤️ Button for refferal system looks cute and clickable.<br />
      </p>

      <h4>Room for Improvement</h4>
      <p>
        💭 What would a list look like if it started from a template?<br />
        🔧 Include only one control for a planner to designate "Must-Have"
        items, two is confusing.<br />
        🔧 Default text for notes is too suggestive, consider just using
        "Notes".<br />
        🔧 When a planner edits items, including "claimed by" and "assign
        guests" mixes guest and planner actions making the UX confusing.<br />
        🔧 To minimize number of screens, consider making Assign Guests a pop-up
        screen - not full.<br />
        🔧 Must-have desgination shouldn't be clickable for guests, only
        planners can define this.<br />
        🔧 Transparent boxes look clickable for guests, consider a different
        state representation.<br />
        🔧 Spots claimed entry point in guest RSVP should be a seperate screen
        to ensure users do not overlook sign-up.<br />
        🔧 Assign Items icon looks like a clipboard, this can be a toggle.<br />
        🔧 Put practical uses for list templates at the top (car sign up,
        potluck, housing…)
